# Prologue:

As my journey begins, I cannot help but think back on the events that led to the Fabula of Exile.

They doubted me. Mocked me. Conspired to replace me, whom the weakest.....

------------

...Am I going to die here for them?

...After all my injuries and troubles, I only earned a single silver. Considering I put my life on the line to earn this, it's too small.

------------

.....

...You...

...You running from here... Will result in our deaths

------------

...Since it has come down to this, I'm gonna to take at least one monster with me!

Huk Huk...

...Come.

EEEEAAACK!

...I don't wanna...

... don't wanna die

... I don't wanna die!!

... OF COURSE it's not "FINE".

... What do you mean "THANKFUL"!

... Quit it with all these betrayals!

... I have a family too...!

... I don't wanna die either!!!!

... Glad for being the only one dying here?

... Stop lying to yourself!
